# Combined Bind List [1.21.1-1.21.4]

RusherHack Hud Element to display BindList from both meteorclient and rusherhack with customization and ability to hide individual modules.

- **```*combindlist``` to manage all modules with assigned keybinds.**

- Alternatively, you can use **```*drawn```** to hide and show specifically RusherHack modules, **which will also hide them from the FeatureList Hud Element!**

- **For some external modules (plugins) with specific names,** you need to use quotation marks around the module name, for example: **```*combindlist add "Item Frame Dupe"```**
